# Description
Welcome to the repository for the  E-Commerce Public Dataset Dashboard project! This project is the final assignment from the Dicoding course called "Learning Data Analysis with Python". It features a detailed data dashboard that gives information about the e-commerce dataset. There is also a notebook that includes data cleaning and an exploration of the data (EDA).

# Project Overview
Dashboard: Check out the interactive and lively dashboard made with Streamlit. Learn important information about e-commerce data like how well sales are doing, what kinds of products are being sold, who the customers are, and more.

Notebook: Get into the details of data preparation and exploratory data analysis (EDA) with the included Jupyter notebook. See how we tidy up the data, pull out significant insights, and reveal unseen patterns and trends. This notebook is a great tool for anyone looking to get a grasp on analyzing data.
